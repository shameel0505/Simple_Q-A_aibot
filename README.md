Q&A Chatbot

Project Overview

This is a simple AI-powered chatbot built as part of an internship assignment. The bot allows users to type questions and receive concise, human-readable answers using the Google Gemini API.

The project demonstrates not just coding, but also my learning journey, problem-solving, and experimentation with AI tools.
How It Works
	â€¢	Users type a question in a command-line interface or the Streamlit front-end.
	â€¢	The bot sends the question to Google Gemini and returns a clear, concise, human-readable response.
	â€¢	The bot maintains conversation context, so multi-turn dialogues feel natural.

 My Journey

First Attempt: OpenAI API
	â€¢	I initially tried building this chatbot using OpenAIâ€™s free tier.
	â€¢	It worked, but I quickly ran into token restrictions, which made it difficult to maintain longer conversations or handle detailed queries.

 Switching to Google Gemini
	â€¢	I researched alternatives and found Google Gemini via their Python SDK.
	â€¢	Gemini allowed longer context, better multi-turn conversations, and fast responses.
	â€¢	I configured the model with generation settings to keep answers concise, informative, and human-like.

 Learning & Experimenting
	â€¢	I Googled documentation, watched tutorials, and used ChatGPT as a coding partner to figure out API usage, error handling, and chat session management.
	â€¢	I experimented with different system instructions to make the bot friendly, concise, and informative.
	â€¢	I learned how to handle conversation history and maintain state across multiple turns.

 Going Beyond the Minimum
	â€¢	Added a Streamlit front-end to make the chatbot interactive and user-friendly.
	â€¢	Implemented session-based chat history so the bot remembers the conversation context.
	â€¢	Ensured the bot can gracefully handle exits and empty inputs.

## ðŸ‘€ Example Conversation
```
Bot: Hello, how can I help you?
You: What is photosynthesis?
Bot: Photosynthesis is how plants make food using sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide. 
     Imagine a plant as a little chef mixing ingredients to make sugar!
